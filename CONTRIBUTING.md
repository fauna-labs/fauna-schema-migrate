## Code of Conduct

Fauna is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone in the Fauna community, and we need your help to ensure that everyone feels welcomed. By participating and contributing to Fauna Labs, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://forums.fauna.com/guidelines).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

- To report security vulnerabilities, please follow the guidance in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request new features, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Please search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new issue. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) also indicates that a particular problem affects more than just the reporter.

### Commit
In order to properly commit, please make sure you do `git add <your_file>` then run the script
`npm run commit`

It will walk you through a 5 step wizard where you first identify a *type* of change, a short description (usually the feature name e.g add changelog w packages git-cz & generate-changelog) which we use to create a changelog, then a longer description for clarity, then if there are any breaking changes and finally the issue that this commit is linked to.

### Pull Requests

PRs to Fauna Labs repositories are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the fewest number of changed lines possible.
- Include documentation in the repository.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

Breaking changes require an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

Fauna Labs follows the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)
